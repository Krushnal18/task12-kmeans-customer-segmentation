# Task 11: SVM – Breast Cancer Classification

## Objective
To build and evaluate a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for breast cancer classification using the sklearn dataset.

## Dataset
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (sklearn)

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained Linear and RBF SVM models
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
- Evaluated model using confusion matrix, classification report
- Plotted ROC curve and calculated AUC score
- Saved the final trained model pipeline

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Output
- Jupyter Notebook
- ROC Curve with AUC
- Saved SVM model file (.pkl)

## Result
The tuned RBF SVM achieved high classification accuracy and strong AUC performance.
